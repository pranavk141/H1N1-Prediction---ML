## Prediction of H1N1 Vaccine <br>
In this project, we will look at vaccination, a vital public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and a well-immunized community can further reduce the spread of diseases through "herd immunity".<br>

Because there has not been a vaccination developed for COVID-19 as of now, the competition will instead examine the public health response to a recent major respiratory disease pandemic. In spring 2009, an epidemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, also commonly known as "swine flu," swept across the world. Researchers estimate that it was responsible for between 151,000 to 575,000 deaths globally in the first year.<br>

An H1N1 flu vaccine became publicly available in October 2009. The U.S. government conducted the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) via phone. The survey asked respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines with questions about themselves. These additional questions covered respondents' various information such as background (social, economic, and demographic), opinions on risks of disease and vaccine effectiveness, and so on. A better understanding of these characteristics and individual vaccination patterns can guide future public health efforts.<br>

Aim of this project is to predict whether people got H1N1 vaccines using information they shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors.<br>
